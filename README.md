# Hi there! 👋

🎓 **MBA in Finance & Business Analytics**  
🏦 **Ex-Valuations Analyst @ EY GDS**  
🐍 **Machine Learning Enthusiast**  
🤖 **Aspiring Data Scientist (with a splash of paint!)**

---

From crunching valuations at Ernst & Young GDS to crunching code as a self-taught data wrangler, I’ve spent 2+ years turning complex financial puzzles into clear, actionable insights. Now, I’m channeling my finance acumen and analytical superpowers into the world of data science—where machine learning meets money matters!

**My toolkit:**  
- Python & SQL (self-taught and loving it!)
- Machine Learning (finance-focused, real-world projects galore)
- A knack for translating business needs into data-driven solutions

When I’m not decoding datasets or hunting for the next “a-ha!” moment, you’ll find me with a paintbrush in hand—proving data and creativity are not mutually exclusive.
